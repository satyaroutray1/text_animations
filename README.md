# 🎉 Flutter Text Animations Playground

A collection of fun and creative text animations built using **Flutter**, inspired by the awesome [react-bits](https://github.com/DavidHDev/react-bits) repository.

This project showcases multiple text effects that can be used in portfolios, intros, onboarding screens, or just for fun UI experimentation.
